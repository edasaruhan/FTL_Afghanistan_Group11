Feedback Lit review
Your literature and technology reviews provide a strong foundation for the flood prediction project.
To improve further, focus on making the connection between the reviewed methods and your specific approach clearer.
Highlight how your project addresses the gaps in existing studies, especially with Afghanistan's unique challenges in data availability and disaster management. 
Adding a brief explanation of why your chosen technologies are ideal for your context would also make the review more impactful.

Feedback Idea Proposal

Consider integrating real-time flood alerts for communities via mobile apps or SMS, ensuring the predictions are actionable.
Expand the scope to include flood impact prediction, such as potential damage to infrastructure or loss estimates, which could aid in resource allocation.
Discuss any gaps in existing research, such as limited scalability, lack of real-time applications, or the challenge of integrating diverse data types, and how your project addresses these.
Include heatmaps or visual overlays on satellite imagery to display high-risk flood zones clearly, aiding decision-making for disaster management teams.

This are suggestion but overall really nice assignments, Thank you :)
